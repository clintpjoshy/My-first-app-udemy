<!-- since we need to send data from cockpit component which is a sibling it needs to be sent to the parent first. This can be done using events. Here serverAdded is an event defined on app-cockpit component. When this event is fired  form that component it fires the callbacks with $event. go to cockpit.component.ts-->
<app-cockpit (serverAdded)="onServerAdded($event)" (blueprintAdded)="onBlueprintAdded($event)"></app-cockpit>

<!-- app-server-element component has a property called element that is defined. And therefore available here. So here we are passing a value form app.component to app-server-element component as property binding. For each app-server-element component current serverElement is passed as the property of the element. This is not available immediately. For further details check app-server-element component -->
